I'm a programmer with a fair amount of professional experience in Java and related technologies. I've started this blog as both a personal portfolio and a collection of useful articles and resources. Apart from this blog and git profile, I'm also somewhat active on [stack overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/users/5752737/william-burnham).
