## Binary to base64 and vice versa

Sometimes it's necessary to convert a non-textual file to base64. An example of this might be for embedding a jpeg image in a data url. I made a client-side react app to do just that, as well as the opposite (given a base64, save the raw decoded bytes).

Use the [app](https://wrburnham.github.io/etc/base64-bin-util) in your browser or check out the [source code](https://github.com/wrburnham/base64-bin-util).

**Update**: it's a work in progress and may not work on all browsers across all devices yet.
