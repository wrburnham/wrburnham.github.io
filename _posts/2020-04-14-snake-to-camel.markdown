What's snake case anyway? What's camel case? Where did these words come from?

Underscores have long been used as word separators, such as when naming variables. Consider

{% highlight c %}
int some\_number = 4;
{% endhighlight %}

and 

{% highlight java %}
int someNumber = 4;
{% endhighlight %}

> There are only two hard things in Computer Science: cache invalidation and naming things.

I'm not really sure where the terms came from but there sure are a lot of them, more than I would have imagined. Snake case, camel case, kebab case, pascal case, etc.

One helpful rule in coding is consistent naming / code conventions.
