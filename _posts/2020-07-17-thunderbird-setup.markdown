This is a basic guide intended for setting up an open-source email client on a desktop computer. It's for non technical users and the email client is Mozilla thunderbird.

1. Install [Thunderbird](https://www.thunderbird.net). At the time of writing, the Windows installer (64 bit) is [here](https://download.mozilla.org/?product=thunderbird-78.0-msi-SSL&os=win64&lang=en-CA).

2. Once Thunderbird is installed, click **Local Folders** in the home screen on the left-hand pane. The main view will update to show **Thunderbird Mail - Local Folders**. In the **Accounts** section under the **Set up an account** label, click **Email**.

3. In the **Set Up an Existing Email Account** window, fill out the details as appropriate: **Your name**, **Email address** and **Password**. __**Note**__: your password will be stored on your computer if the **Remember password** checkbox is selected. Click the **Manual config** button. Enter the other values as appropriate (ask your hosting company if unsure).

4. When all info is entered, click **Re-test**. If no error messages are shown, Thunderbird has been successfully configured to read the mailbox provided in the previous step.

5. Click **Done** to finish set-up. When set-up finishes, the mailbox will be available in the left-hand pane above **Local Folders**. Click on it to expand and see its contents.
