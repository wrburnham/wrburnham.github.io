This project is a small GUI utility (one window) written in Java for sending kafka messages. It's written in java 8 and uses the swing library. I chose not to use javafx only because I'm more familiar with swing.

An executable jar is available [here](https://wrburnham.github.io/etc/kafka-producer-1.0.0.jar) as well as the [source code](https://github.com/wrburnham/kafka-producer).
