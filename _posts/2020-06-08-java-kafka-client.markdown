This project is a small GUI utility (one window) written in Java for sending kafka messages. It's written in java 8 and uses the swing library. I made this project because with the default kafka producer (shell) it's not possible to send headers. Also, I wanted to be able to save kafka requests for reuse later.

The [source code](https://github.com/wrburnham/kafka-producer) is available here. See the readme for building a standalone jar or download it [here](https://github.com/wrburnham/kafka-producer/releases/download/1.0.0/kafka-producer-1.0.0.jar).
