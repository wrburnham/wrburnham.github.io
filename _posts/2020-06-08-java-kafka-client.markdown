This project is a small GUI utility (one window) written in Java for sending kafka messages. It's written in java 8 and uses the swing library. I chose not to use javafx only because I'm more familiar with swing.

The [source code](https://github.com/wrburnham/kafka-producer) is available here. See the readme for building a standalone jar.
